# Replacing DocsPage with custom `MDX` content

This file is a documentation-only `MDX`file to customize Storybook's [DocsPage](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-docs/docs-page#replacing-docspage).

It can be further expanded with your own code snippets and include specific information related to your stories.

For example:

import { Story } from "@storybook/addon-docs";

## Button

Button is the primary component. It has four possible states.

- [Primary](#primary)
- [Secondary](#secondary)
- [Large](#large)
- [Small](#small)

## With the story title defined

If you included the title in the story's default export, use this approach.

### Primary

<Story id="example-button--primary" />

### Secondary

<Story id="example-button--secondary" />

### Large

<Story id="example-button--large" />

### Small

<Story id="example-button--small" />

## Without the story title defined

If you didn't include the title in the story's default export, use this approach.

### Primary

<Story id="your-directory-button--primary"/>

### Secondary

<Story id="your-directory-button--secondary"/>

### Large

<Story id="your-directory-button--large"/>

### Small

<Story id="your-directory-button--small" />

# Definition

Button is a clickable interactive element that triggers a response.

You can place text and icons inside of a button.

Buttons are often used for form submissions and to toggle elements into view.

## Usage

The component comes in different variants such as `primary`, `secondary`, `large` and `small` which you can use to alter the look and feel of the button.

## Inputs

Button has the following properties:

- `primary` - If `true`, the button will have a primary style.
- `size` - The size of the button.
- `label` - The label of the button.
- `backgroundColor` - The background color of the button.
- `onClick` - Callback function when clicked.
```

# Select

Select is a type of input that allows users to choose one or more options from a list of choices. 

The options are hidden by default and revealed when a user interacts with an element. 

It shows the currently selected option in its default collapsed state.

## Design implementation

To help users get acquainted with the existing UI elements, it is recommended to use check the Figma file to see how the select input is implemented.

### When to use?

In a select input where there are less than 3-4 items, consider using radio boxes, or radio inputs instead. 

### How to use?

To help users understand the options available in a select input, include a default option that is unselectable and acts as a label.

<Guidelines>
  <Dos>
    - Use buttons for the main actions on your page 
    - Identify the primary action and make it `primary`
  </Dos>
  <Donts>
    - Use a button when a link will do (e.g., for navigation-only actions) 
    - Use multiple `primary` buttons in a single UI state
  </Donts>

# Page

Page is a layout container that is used to position children in predetermined areas. 

It's often used to apply consistent positioning for content across pages in an application

## Usage

<Canvas of={PageStories.Basic} />

# List

List is a grouping of related items. List can be ordered with multiple levels of nesting.

## Usage

<Story of={ListStories.Filled} />

# List Item

List items are used to group related content in a list. They must be nested within a List component.

## Usage

<Story of={ListItemStories.Starter} meta={ListItemStories} />

## Design Resources

### Figma

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/) is a collaborative design and prototyping tool. It's the heart of the design process, allowing designers to work together seamlessly.

- **Get Access**: If you're not already part of the Figma project, request access from the project lead or manager.

### UI/UX Design Guidelines

Before you dive into designing, familiarize yourself with our UI/UX design guidelines. They provide valuable insights into our design philosophy and standards.

- [UI/UX Guidelines Document](https://your-design-guidelines-link.com)

### Design Assets

All the essential design assets like logos, icons, and brand guidelines can be found in the Figma project. Ensure you have access and familiarize yourself with these assets for consistency.

---

## Development Resources

### Coding Standards

Maintaining a consistent code style is essential for collaborative development. Our coding standards document will guide you on best practices.

- [Coding Standards Document](https://your-coding-standards-link.com)

### Version Control

We use Git for version control. Make sure you have Git installed and are familiar with its basics.

### Development Tools

Your development environment is critical. Here are some tools and resources to help you set up your workspace:

- **Code Editor**: We recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for development. It's highly customizable and supports a wide range of extensions.

- **Package Manager**: [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) is the package manager we use for JavaScript projects. Install it to manage project dependencies.
